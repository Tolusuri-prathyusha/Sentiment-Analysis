# Sentiment Analysis

## Introduction

This project focuses on sentiment analysis, a natural language processing (NLP) task aimed at determining the sentiment expressed in a piece of text. The sentiment can be positive, negative, or neutral.

## Dataset

The dataset used for this project consists of a collection of text data labeled with sentiment categories. It includes sentences or documents along with their corresponding sentiment labels. This dataset serves as the training and testing data for building sentiment analysis models.

## Model Architecture

Various machine learning and deep learning techniques can be employed for sentiment analysis. Common approaches include:

- **Bag-of-Words (BoW)**: This method represents text data as a bag of its constituent words, disregarding grammar and word order.
  
- **Word Embeddings**: Techniques like Word2Vec, GloVe, and FastText provide dense vector representations of words in a continuous vector space, capturing semantic relationships between words.
  
- **Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs)**: RNNs, including Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) and Gated Recurrent Unit (GRU), are effective in capturing contextual information in sequential data such as text.
  
- **Transformer Models**: Pre-trained models like BERT, GPT, and XLNet have achieved state-of-the-art performance in various NLP tasks, including sentiment analysis.

The choice of model architecture depends on factors such as the size and complexity of the dataset, available computational resources, and desired performance.

## Training

The sentiment analysis model is trained using the labeled dataset. The training process involves feeding the input text data into the model and adjusting its parameters to minimize a predefined loss function. Gradient-based optimization algorithms like Adam or stochastic gradient descent (SGD) are commonly used to update the model weights during training.

## Evaluation

The performance of the sentiment analysis model is evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score. These metrics provide insights into how well the model predicts sentiment labels compared to the ground truth.

## Results

The performance of the sentiment analysis model is assessed on a separate test dataset. The evaluation metrics demonstrate the model's effectiveness in accurately predicting sentiment labels for unseen text data.
